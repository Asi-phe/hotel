# hotel

Created the layout using HTML 5
Styled all the front end using CSS3
Added background image in CSS
Added a submit button for a user to be able to submit all the bookings.
When the booking is submitted a user must be able to confirm the bookings.
For submitting I have used PHP so the booking can be comfirmed in the database.
All the details of the user are stored in a database as soon as the booking is confirmed.
