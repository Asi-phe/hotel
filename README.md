In oder to be able to view this App you need to have installed WampSever in Desktop or MammpSever.
How to use it ?
Fill in the form that is provided in your hoem screen ans click submit button,and the screen will prompt you a message that tells you u have made a booking and it show another button for you to comfirm the booking
Created the layout using HTML 5
Styled all the front end using CSS3
Added background image in CSS
Added a submit button for a user to be able to submit all the bookings.
When the booking is submitted a user must be able to confirm the bookings.
For submitting I have used PHP so the booking can be comfirmed in the database.
All the details of the user are stored in a database as soon as the booking is confirmed.
